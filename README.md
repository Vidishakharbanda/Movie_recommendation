create a user-friendly website interface.
Implemented rigorous evaluation metrics, including F1 score, accuracy, and recall, to finely tune recommendation algorithms for optimal performance. This process ensured the accuracy and
effectiveness of the recommendation engine while providing
valuable insights for ongoing refinement and enhancement efforts.
